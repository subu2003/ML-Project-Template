## Model(s) Used
1.Linear regression
A linear regression is a model where the relationship between inputs and outputs is a straight line. This is the easiest to conceptualize and even observe in the real world. Even when a relationship isn’t very linear, our brains try to see the pattern and attach a rudimentary linear model to that relationship.
2.Random forest
Random Forest Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that uses ensemble learning method for regression. Ensemble learning method is a technique that combines predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms to make a more accurate prediction than a single model.
